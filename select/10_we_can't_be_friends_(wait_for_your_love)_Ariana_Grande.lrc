[00:06.90] I didn't think you'd understand me
[00:15.50] How could you ever even try?
[00:23.71] I don't wanna tiptoe but I don't wanna hide
[00:27.72] But I don't wanna feed this monstruous fire
[00:32.13] Just wanna let this story die
[00:36.79] And I'll be alright
[00:46.29] 
[00:39.38] We can't be friends
[00:42.47] But I'd like to just pre-tend
[00:46.75] You cling to your papers and pens
[00:50.80] Wait until you like me again
[01:04.80] 
[00:55.03] Wait for your love
[00:57.74] My love, I'll wait for your love
[01:13.74] 
[01:05.26] Me and my truth, we sit in silence
[01:11.89] Mm, baby girl, it's just me and you
[01:21.39] 'Cause I don't wanna argue but I don't wanna bite my tongue
[01:26.40] I think I'd rather die
[01:30.29] You got me misunderstood
[01:32.66] But at least I look this good
[01:47.16] 
[01:37.34] We can't be friends
[01:40.69] But I'd like to just pre-tend
[01:44.69] You cling to your papers and pens
[01:48.73] Wait until you like me again
[02:02.73] 
[01:52.80] Wait for your love
[01:55.66] My love, I'll wait for your love
[02:01.19] I'll wait for your love
[02:03.87] My love, I'll wait for your love
[02:19.87] 
[02:09.29] Know that you made me
[02:13.44] I don't like how you paint me, yet I'm still here hangin'
[02:17.80] Not what you made me
[02:21.71] It's somethin' like a daydream
[02:24.09] But I feel so seen in the night
[02:28.42] So for now, it's only me
[02:32.62] And maybe that's all I need
[02:46.12] 
[02:35.50] We can't be friends
[02:38.13] But I'd like to just pre-tend
[02:42.45] You cling to your papers and pens
[02:46.60] Wait until you like me again
[03:00.60] 
[02:50.92] Wait for your love
[02:53.42] My love, I'll wait for your love
[02:58.85] I'll wait for your love
[03:01.82] My love, I'll wait for your love
[03:17.82] 
[03:04.26] I'll wait for your love
[03:08.30] I'll wait for your love
[03:12.09] I'll wait for your love
[03:16.25] I'll wait for your love
[03:20.38] I'll wait for your love
