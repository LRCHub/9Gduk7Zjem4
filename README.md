[00:07.10] I didn't think you'd understand me
[00:15.52] How could you ever even try?
[00:23.32] I don't wanna tiptoe, but I don't wanna hide
[00:27.65] But I don't wanna feed this monstrous fire
[00:31.82] Just wanna let this story die
[00:36.26] And I'll be alright
[00:45.76] 
[00:39.30] We can't be friends
[00:42.49] But I'd like to just pretend
[00:46.55] You cling to your papers and pens
[00:50.88] Wait until you like me again
[01:04.88] 
[00:54.79] Wait for your love
[00:57.55] Love, I'll wait for your love
[01:12.05] 
[01:04.94] Me and my truth, we sit in silence
[01:13.44] Baby girl, it's just me and you
[01:21.34] 'Cause I don't wanna argue, but I don't wanna bite
[01:25.44] My tongue, yeah, I think I'd rather die
[01:29.78] You got me misunderstood, but at least I look this good
[01:57.28] 
[01:37.44] We can't be friends
[01:40.41] But I'd like to just pretend
[01:44.47] You cling to your papers and pens
[01:48.72] Wait until you like me again
[02:02.72] 
[01:52.82] Wait for your love
[01:55.34] Love, I'll wait for your love
[02:00.96] I'll wait for your love
[02:03.87] Love, I'll wait for your love
[02:18.37] 
[02:09.29] Know that you made me
[02:13.48] I don't like how you paint me, yet I'm still here hanging
[02:17.82] Not what you made me
[02:21.63] It's something like a daydream
[02:24.28] But I feel so seen in the night
[02:28.08] So for now, it's only me
[02:32.40] And maybe that's all I need
[02:45.90] 
[02:35.40] We can't be friends
[02:38.26] But I'd like to just pretend
[02:42.34] You cling to your papers and pens
[02:46.46] Wait until you like me again
[03:00.46] 
[02:50.52] Wait for your love
[02:53.65] Love, I'll wait for your love
[02:58.65] I'll wait for your love
[03:01.98] Love, I'll wait for your love
[03:16.48] 
[03:07.17] I'll wait for your love
[03:11.16] I'll wait for your love
[03:15.57] I'll wait for your love
[03:19.56] I'll wait for your love
[03:23.62] I'll wait for your love
